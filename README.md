Files

The code assumes that all data is in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. I had no problem performing steps 1-4 in
R Studio. However step 5 returned an error message.
